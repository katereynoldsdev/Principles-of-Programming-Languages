# Principles-of-Programming-Languages
Studies principles governing the design and analysis of programming languages and their underlying execution models. Explores values, scoping, recursion, higher-order functions, type systems, control structures, and objects. Introduces formal semantics as a framework for understanding programming features. Introduces advanced programming concepts such as functional programming, higher-order functions, immutable values and structures, inductive types, functors, continuation-passing; and object-oriented programming using inheritance, generics and covariance/contravariance in a functional programming language such as Scala.
